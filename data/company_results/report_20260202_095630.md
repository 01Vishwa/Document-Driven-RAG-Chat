## Analysis

### Strengths
- Questions with high retrieval hit rate indicate good embedding and indexing quality
- High faithfulness rate shows the grounding mechanisms are working

### Areas for Improvement
- Questions with low retrieval hit may need better chunking or embedding strategies
- Hallucinations should be investigated for patterns

### Recommendations
1. Review worst-performing questions for retrieval improvements
2. Analyze hallucination patterns for additional guardrails
3. Consider hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector) for keyword-heavy questions
