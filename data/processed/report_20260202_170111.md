### 5. A pilot planning a flight notices that the destination weather is forecast to be at minimums at the ETA, but the trend shows improvement. The departure weather is good. Should the flight be dispatched, and what contingencies should be in place?

**Answer:** This information is not available in the provided document(s).

- **Confidence:** 29.8%
- **Grounded:** No
- **Faithful:** Yes

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Questions with high retrieval hit rate indicate good embedding and indexing quality
- High faithfulness rate shows the grounding mechanisms are working

### Areas for Improvement
- Questions with low retrieval hit may need better chunking or embedding strategies
- Hallucinations should be investigated for patterns

### Recommendations
1. Review worst-performing questions for retrieval improvements
2. Analyze hallucination patterns for additional guardrails
3. Consider hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector) for keyword-heavy questions
