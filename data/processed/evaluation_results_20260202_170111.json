(3) Deviating 50nm: Adds fuel burn and time, may or may not avoid turbulence if widespread. Recommendation: Descend to FL350 is typically most practical for a heavy aircraft with limited fuel.

Recommendation: If emergency oxygen is functioning for crew and passengers, the 2-minute deviation to avoid severe turbulence is safer - structural failure is catastrophic while the oxygen systems provide a safety margin.
