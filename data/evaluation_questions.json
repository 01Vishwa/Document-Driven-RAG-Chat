      "question_type": "reasoning",
      "expected_answer": "This is potentially unsafe. As fuel burns, CG typically moves based on fuel tank location. If CG is at the aft limit at takeoff and moves further aft during flight, the aircraft could exceed aft CG limits mid-flight, potentially causing: reduced stability, difficulty controlling pitch, risk of uncontrollable pitch-up, and difficulty recovering from unusual attitudes. The pilot should recalculate with actual weights, consider load redistribution, or reduce fuel/payload to ensure CG remains within limits throughout the flight envelope.",

For turns: use timed turns with turn coordinator (standard rate = 3°/sec). Maintain wings level by keeping turn coordinator centered, adjust pitch using airspeed and VSI.

      "question_type": "reasoning",
      "expected_answer": "Analysis: (1) Climbing to FL410: Heavy weight may limit climb capability, and turbulence often exists at multiple levels; requires fuel and performance consideration. (2) Descending to FL350: Usually more practical when heavy, increases fuel burn but exits most CAT which typically occurs near the tropopause/jet stream. (3) Deviating 50nm: Adds fuel burn and time, may or may not avoid turbulence if widespread. Recommendation: Descend to FL350 is typically most practical for a heavy aircraft with limited fuel. Climbing requires performance margins that may not exist, and lateral deviation doesn't guarantee avoiding CAT while consuming fuel. Always cross-check with pilot reports and ATC.",

      "question": "A pilot is tracking a VOR radial and notices the CDI gradually drifting despite maintaining the same heading. The DME shows decreasing distance. What is happening and what corrections are needed?",
      "question_type": "reasoning",
      "expected_answer": "The gradual CDI drift with constant heading indicates a crosswind component. As DME decreases (getting closer to station), the same angular error represents less linear deviation, but the wind drift accumulates. The pilot should: (1) Note the direction of drift (which way CDI is moving), (2) Turn into the wind (toward the needle) to re-intercept, (3) Apply a wind correction angle by maintaining a heading slightly into the wind, (4) The correction angle needed may change as you get closer to the station (VOR sensitivity increases near the station). Continuously monitor and adjust the heading to maintain course.",

      "question": "During cruise, the pilot notices fuel consumption is higher than planned. The aircraft can either: (A) continue to destination with minimum reserves, (B) divert to a closer alternate with comfortable reserves, or (C) request a lower altitude with better fuel efficiency but longer flight time. How should this decision be approached?",
      "question_type": "reasoning",
      "expected_answer": "Decision framework: (1) Calculate actual fuel remaining and compare with legal requirements (never continue below legal minimums). (2) Option A risks safety margins - generally unacceptable unless weather and conditions are ideal and the shortage is minor. (3) Option B ensures safety but incurs operational cost and delay. (4) Option C may work if: lower altitude actually improves economy (check performance data - not always true), the added time doesn't negate the efficiency gain, weather at lower altitude is acceptable. Best practice: If there's any doubt, divert (Option B). Never compromise safety margins. Also consider: rechecking fuel quantity, leaning mixture, reducing speed for better range, and communicating with dispatch/ATC.",

      "question_type": "reasoning",
      "expected_answer": "The flight can be dispatched if: (1) Alternate airport requirements are met (suitable alternate with weather above minimums), (2) Sufficient fuel for destination + missed approach + alternate + reserves, (3) The improvement trend is from a reliable source. Contingencies: (1) File with an alternate airport, (2) Monitor weather updates continuously, (3) Establish a 'decision point' where commitment to destination vs alternate must be made, (4) Have a backup plan if trend reverses, (5) Consider departure delay if improvement is expected shortly. Key principle: Never plan to arrive at a destination that is below landing minimums - always have legal options available.",

      "question": "An aircraft experiences a rapid decompression at FL400. After completing immediate memory items, the pilot must decide between: (A) emergency descent to 10,000 ft directly below, which passes through known severe turbulence, or (B) emergency descent with a deviation that avoids turbulence but takes 2 more minutes. Which should be chosen?",
      "question_type": "reasoning",
      "expected_answer": "This requires balancing hypoxia risk against structural risk. Key considerations: (1) Time of useful consciousness at FL400 is approximately 15-30 seconds without supplemental oxygen. (2) Once on emergency oxygen, crew has more time but passenger oxygen duration varies. (3) Severe turbulence at high speed could cause structural damage or injury. Recommendation: If emergency oxygen is functioning for crew and passengers, the 2-minute deviation to avoid severe turbulence is safer - structural failure is catastrophic while the oxygen systems provide a safety margin. However, if there's any doubt about oxygen supply, direct descent takes priority as hypoxia is immediately incapacitating. Reduce speed for turbulence penetration if passing through is unavoidable.",

      "question_type": "reasoning",
      "expected_answer": "Analysis requires considering: (1) One dot high on glide slope at 1000 AGL is typically acceptable if stabilized approach criteria can still be met. (2) Being high means you have extra altitude margin for obstacles. (3) At minimums weather, visual acquisition at decision height is critical. (4) A stabilized approach typically requires being on glide slope by 500-1000 AGL. Recommendation: Continue the approach but immediately begin correction to recapture glide slope from above (reduce power, increase descent rate slightly). If not back on glide slope by 500 AGL with stable parameters (airspeed, configuration, sink rate), execute a missed approach. Being high is safer than being low, but a destabilized approach at minimums is dangerous.",
